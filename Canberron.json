          "The current monarch of Aundair, Queen Aurala is an insightful and cunning woman. Although Queen Aurala is not a talented mage, nor extraordinarily skilled with arms and armor, her true power lies in her diplomatic skill and ability to expertly navigate the political intrigues of nations and thrones.",
          "Through the Royal Eyes of Aundair, her personal intelligence agency, Queen Aurala is aware of most schemes and motivations within her court. With a benevolent smile or a cutting remark, she plays her nobles to her own advantage and pits rivals against each other— often times, including her two Warlords.",
          "Queen Aurala’s greatest disappointment is most likely the Treaty of Thronehold. Aundair suffered more loss of territory than any country—except, of course, Cyre. With the succession of the Eldeen Reaches, and Thrane’s conquering of Thaliost, Aundair came out of the Last War much diminished. The Treaty upheld these loses, drawing the current political borders of the Five Nations, and Aurala cannot help but sting at the “finalization” of her nation’s defeats in these arenas.",
          "But the Queen of Aundair despairs for not just the lost glory of her own kingdom, but that of the unified Kingdom of Galifar as well. In her heart of hearts, Aurala believes that the Kingdom of Galifar must be reestablished for the good of all the peoples of Khorvaire—and that she is the only ruler worthy of sitting upon the throne of Galifar once again. In her eyes, King Boranel of Breland cares so little for his people that he lets crime and corruption run rampant in his nation. The ir’Wynarns of Thrane have been reduced to figureheads while a cult of zealous fanatics runs the country. King Kaius III of Karrnath is a brutal tyrant that has stripped his people of their rights, once protected by the Code of Galifar. And poor Prince Oragev of Cyre-That-Was no longer has any relevance. Meanwhile, with Aurala’s guiding hand, the people of Aundair enjoy freedom, education, prosperity, and the magical advancements of the Arcane Congress that protect and comfort them. Truly, Khorvaire would enter a new golden age if Aurala’s rule of Aundair spread to all of the Thronehold nations.",
          "Aurala is no blind idealist, however. With her shrewd political acumen, she is not fooled by the current “peace” of the Treaty. She knows that the Last War has not truly ended, merely transitioned to a new cold war, rife with intrigue and sabotage. So, despite her ultimate desire for the peace and prosperity of all of Khorvaire, Aurala makes preparations for renewed hostilities, training and recruiting mages, soldiers, and spies. The Queen of Aundair is determined that when the Last War’s outright hostilities resume, her nation will not only be ready—but victorious."

However, he sees himself as that ruling monarch, believing he is the true power behind Aundair’s throne, with only an accident of birth keeping himself from being King.",

To that effect, he and a cabal of amoral wizards under his supervision are researching devastating war magic. Adal hopes to create a single arcane event capable of eradicating an entire army or city in but a moment. With this hypothetical spell—referred to in his notes as apocalypse from the sky—he will decimate Thrane’s forces around Thaliost, and cow the rest of the Thronehold nations into surrender."
