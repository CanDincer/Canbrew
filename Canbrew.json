In order to create this bond, you and a friendly creature with whom you are close perform a brief, 1-minute ritual to connect your destinies and forge a blood pact. When you create this blood pact, you must each agree on a number of hit points to permanently sacrifice, reducing your total maximum hit points (minimum 1). Once a pact has been forged, trickles of the bound creatures' blood are absorbed into the normally clear gem adorning the face of this pendant. While the gem is filled in this way, it seems to gently swirl and pulse in time with your heartbeat.",
                "While each bound creature is wearing their pendant and both are on the same plane of existence, they're protected by this pact so long as one creature is still conscious. When a bound creature dies, they're immediately revived with {@dice 2d10} hit points plus twice the number of hit points previously sacrificed by the creature. When a creature is revived in this way, the other bound creature immediately falls to 0 hit points and is knocked unconscious. This property ignores any effect that would normally prevent a creature from falling to 0 hit points. When this happens, both creatures' maximum hit points are returned to normal. Once the pact is ended in this way, the gems and pendants crack and are no longer magical."

If a number of water minimentals gather in a town’s well or potable water source, they form invisible barriers that make it difficult to access the water underneath. Due to this trait, they can be a nuisance to towns that find themselves with an infestation.

These minimentals are most often observed in the form of small cloud formations of varying colour, which tend to change with their mood. They are light enough to fly, but risk getting carried away by gusts of wind if they stray too far from the ground, tending to stick to the gentler currents close to the earth. Due to their erratically nomadic nature, they are most often encountered alone. When upset, or even when simply sneezing, they can accidentally discharge a static shock. An individual air minimental’s shocks are not much of a threat, but large, grumpy groups of them can generate surprisingly intense thunderstorms that may pose a threat to less structurally sound buildings."

They are social by nature, and will happily form squads of other earth minimentals to travel with, though often break apart due to members tripping and rolling away from their kin. Large groups of them can create dangerous terrain, especially when rolling down slopes. Earth minimentals who have been on the material plane may go through a change similar to adolescence in humans, and small precious gems can grow on their face."

They tend to be very wary of creatures, mostly keeping to themselves, and are usually shy if approached. Dust minimentals are sleepy and quite content to doze the day away with others of their kind in the quiet darkness, away from loud noises and wind. Once they find a suitable corner or neglected shelf, they rarely move unless disturbed. They are able to contort their body to fil natural crevices and escape predators through tiny openings."
