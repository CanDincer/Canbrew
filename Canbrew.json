When you create this blood pact, you must each agree on a number of hit points to permanently sacrifice, reducing your total maximum hit points (minimum 1).

When a creature is revived in this way, the other bound creature immediately falls to 0 hit points and is knocked unconscious. This property ignores any effect that would normally prevent a creature from falling to 0 hit points. When this happens, both creatures' maximum hit points are returned to normal.
